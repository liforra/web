        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          Controller: Liforra (<a href="mailto:privacy@liforra.de"
            >privacy@liforra.de</a
          >). If you are in the EU/EEA or UK, Liforra is the controller of your
          personal data processed in connection with the Services.
        </p>

        <h2>Scope and Acceptance</h2>
        <p>
          By accessing or using the Services, you agree to these Terms of
          Service and this Privacy Notice (collectively, the “Terms”). If you do
          not agree, do not use the Services.
        </p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <ul class="snes-list is-ocean-list-color">
          <li>
            We collect certain data when you authenticate with the Bot via
            Discord OAuth to prevent spam and abuse.
          </li>
          <li>
            Routine logs are kept for a limited period; incident-related data is
            kept as long as necessary to enforce bans and protect the Services,
            with periodic reviews.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Website collects aggregated, non-identifiable analytics.
            Analytics can be disabled by blocking scripts (for example, via
            uBlock Origin) or by blocking all scripts for our domain.
          </li>
          <li>
            We do not use cookies for tracking. A single functional cookie may
            be set only to remember that you have accepted this notice so it
            does not reappear.
          </li>
          <li>
            You have GDPR/UK GDPR rights such as access, rectification, erasure,
            restriction, objection, and portability.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data We Collect (Bot via Discord OAuth)</h2>
        <p>When you authenticate with the Bot, we may process:</p>
        <ul class="snes-list is-ocean-list-color">
          <li>Discord account identifiers (e.g., user ID, username)</li>
          <li>E-mail address (if provided via approved OAuth scope)</li>
          <li>IP address and timestamp of authentication</li>
          <li>User agent/device information</li>
          <li>
            Other Discord account metadata provided by the scopes you approve
            during OAuth
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Purposes and Legal Bases</h3>
        <ul class="snes-list is-ocean-list-color">
          <li>
            Security and abuse prevention (anti-spam, rate limiting, ban
            enforcement, fraud prevention). Legal basis: legitimate interests
            (GDPR Art. 6(1)(f)).
          </li>
          <li>
            Operating the Bot and providing requested functionality. Legal
            basis: contract necessity (GDPR Art. 6(1)(b)) where applicable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Compliance with legal obligations. Legal basis: GDPR Art. 6(1)(c)
            where applicable.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Retention (Bot)</h3>
        <ul class="snes-list is-ocean-list-color">
          <li>
            Routine security/authentication logs (including IP, user ID,
            timestamp): retained for up to 90 days, then deleted or anonymized.
          </li>
          <li>
            Incident/abuse records (e.g., data tied to confirmed spam, ban
            evasion, security incidents): retained for the duration of the ban
            or investigation and reviewed at least every 12 months; deleted when
            no longer necessary.
          </li>
          <li>
            Backups: relevant data may persist in encrypted backups for up to 60
            days after deletion from active systems.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data We Collect (Website)</h2>
        <p>
          The Website may collect aggregated usage data to understand service
          performance and prevent abuse. This may include:
        </p>
        <ul class="snes-list is-ocean-list-color">
          <li>Browser and device type</li>
          <li>Country/region (coarse location)</li>
          <li>Visited pages and referrers</li>
          <li>Request volumes and timing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You can disable analytics by blocking scripts (e.g., via uBlock
          Origin) or by blocking all scripts for our domain. Where data is truly
          anonymized and not reasonably linkable to a person, GDPR does not
          apply. Where personal data could be involved (e.g., raw IPs in server
          access logs), we apply the retention rules and legal bases above and
          minimize collection.
        </p>

        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          We do not use cookies for tracking or analytics. A single functional
          cookie may be set solely to remember that you have accepted this
          ToS/Privacy Notice so that it does not reappear on subsequent visits.
        </p>

        <h2>Use of Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          For security purposes, we may query
          <a href="https://ip-api.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">ip-api.com</a>
          about an IP address to determine coarse geolocation or network
          information (e.g., ISP, ASN) to help detect abuse. You should review
          their terms and privacy policy:
          <a href="https://ip-api.com/docs/legal" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >ip-api.com legal</a
          >.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Sharing and International Transfers</h2>
        <p>We do not sell personal data. We may share personal data with:</p>
        <ul class="snes-list is-ocean-list-color">
          <li>
            Service providers who assist with hosting, security, operations
          </li>
          <li>
            Law enforcement or authorities when required by law or to protect
            our rights, users, or the public
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If personal data is transferred outside the EU/EEA/UK, we will rely on
          appropriate safeguards (e.g., adequacy decisions or Standard
          Contractual Clauses) as required by law.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Rights (GDPR/UK GDPR)</h2>
        <p>
          Subject to conditions and applicable law, you have the right to
          request access, rectification, erasure, restriction, objection
          (including to processing based on legitimate interests), and data
          portability. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your
          local supervisory authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          To exercise your rights, contact:
          <a href="mailto:privacy@liforra.de">privacy@liforra.de</a>. You may
          also contact us on Signal at <strong>@liforra.01</strong>. We will
          respond without undue delay and within one month of receipt of a valid
          request. If more time is needed due to complexity or number of
          requests, we may extend by up to two further months and will inform
          you of the extension and reasons. We may need to verify your identity.
        </p>

        <h2>Prohibited Use and Enforcement</h2>
        <p>
          You must not use the Services to harass, spam, abuse, infringe
          intellectual property, or violate law or platform policies (including
          Discord’s Terms and Guidelines). We may suspend or ban users and
          retain incident-related data as described above to enforce these
          Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material
          changes, we will take appropriate steps to notify you (e.g., via the
          Website or Bot). Continued use of the Services after changes take
          effect constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
        </p>
        <h2>Accept and Continue</h2>
        <p>
          By clicking “Accept and continue,” you acknowledge that you have read
          and agree to these Terms of Service and Privacy Notice.
